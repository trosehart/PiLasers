# PiLasers

This project was created during my ECE 150: Fundamentals of Programming course.  It uses a pair of lasers and photodiodes to record the
number of people who entered and exited through a pathway that crosses the lasers.

It was created using a Raspberry Pi.  This project was to learn how basic embedded systems function.
